# Ml-data-Visualization-And-Classification
A Python script that visualizes the classic Iris dataset using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. It loads the dataset from scikit-learn, converts it into a DataFrame, and plots a scatter matrix to show relationships between features. This helps in exploring data patterns and understanding species separation visually.
